//! <p>AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage their
//! access centrally across AWS accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended
//! approach for workforce authentication and authorization in AWS, for organizations of any size
//! and type.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and
//! <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for
//! backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>
//! </note>
//! <p>This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which could be used for
//! access management of AWS accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">IAM Identity Center User
//! Guide</a>.</p>
//! <p>Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as
//! principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center,
//! see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/IdentityStoreAPIReference/welcome.html">Identity Store API
//! Reference</a>.</p>
//! <note>
//! <p>AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
//! languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a
//! convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other AWS services. For more
//! information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>

//! # Crate Organization
//!
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//!
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//!
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//!
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.

// Code generated by software.amazon.smithy.rust.codegen.smithy-rs. DO NOT EDIT.
