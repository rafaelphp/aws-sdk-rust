//! <p> Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in
//! business critical operational applications. You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you
//! want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those
//! resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an
//! <i>insight</i> that includes recommendations, related events, and
//! related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more
//! information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>. </p>
//! 
//! <p> You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight
//! is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each
//! insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights. </p>
//! 
//! <p> To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works">How DevOps Guru works</a>. To
//! learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/concepts.html">Concepts in DevOps Guru</a>. </p>

//! # Crate Organization
//! 
//! The entry point for most customers will be [`Client`]. [`Client`] exposes one method for each API offered
//! by the service.
//! 
//! Some APIs require complex or nested arguments. These exist in [`model`](crate::model).
//! 
//! Lastly, errors that can be returned by the service are contained within [`error`]. [`Error`] defines a meta
//! error encompassing all possible errors that can be returned by the service.
//! 
//! The other modules within this crate are not required for normal usage.
